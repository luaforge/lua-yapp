MathLib
-------

MathLib.prc is an LGPLed IEEE754 library for PalmOS 2.0+ which is
maintained by Rick Huebner.  The MathLib.[ch] convenience wrapper was
released into the public domain.

See http://www.radiks.net/~rhuebner/mathlib.html for more information.


Lua logo
--------

The Lua logo fetched from http://www.lua.org/images/lua-logo-nolabel.ps
was created by Alexandre Nakonechnyj, see the comment at the PostScript
file's top for details.

Unfortunately scaling the .ps version or the 128x128 pixel sized .gif
versions was not appropriate to generate PalmOS application icon bitmap
files.  Although the icons could be recognized, their being dithered
looked ugly for the inverted ("selected") state, and the colors looked
blurry.  In normal (not selected) state, the "excess" colors which
resulted from dithering looked "unnatural" in the launcher.

So these logos had to be "redrawn" according to their target size and
color depth to fit the native PalmOS resolution, while they still should
resemble the original idea.  Except for the "small" 15x9 logo which was
completely whipped up out of thin air by me, Gerhard Sittig.


pdouble.c
---------

This routine to print double precision floating point numbers was
fetched from http://tangentsoft.net/palmfaq/src/pdouble.c, the original
version with additional information about it can be found at
http://www.lispme.de/lispme/gcc/tech.html.  The source was released into
the public domain.

I've moved the declaration into the new pdouble.h header file and added the
"run time lib" code section attribute.
